### Automation-Robotics-Proj
Personal/School project regarding the subject of automation and robotics. 
Author: Yuen Bak Ching (Max)

This is a portfolio of most of the project I had worked in the past years. All of the files: planning, code, reports and pressentations will be inside respective project folders and the folders will include a file thats goes over all the projects breifly. 

A little bit more about myself:
I dove into the field of automation and robotics in my senior year at Georgia Tech, which is the year most of the mechanical engineers started branching off into fields they are interested in after learning all the bascis. 

## Classes I had taken concerning the topic:
# - Mechatronics
    - About integrating circuits, actuators and software
    - Used MSP432 microcontroller for labs and projects, langauge is C99. 
    - Concepts Involved: Communcation protocols (UART, I2C, SPI etc.), circuit design, PWM...
- # Robotics
  - Forward and Reverse Kinematics
  - Avoiding singular configurations and problems of singular configurations
  - Labs using ROS and turtlebots
- #Intro to control system 
  - Modelling system in state-space form
  - Designing open and closed loop control
  - Tuning PID controller with the help of methods such as root-locus
- #Linear control system
  - Learning more complex controllers such as LQR and LQG
  - Designing both controllers and observers and combining them
- #Advanced Control Implementation
  - Learnt in depth control system such as LQR, Model-reference control, Input-Shaping
  - Implement different control system on cranes and understand their limitations
- #Machine Learning
  - Running algorithms for supervised, unsupervised and reinforced learning
- #Machine Vision
